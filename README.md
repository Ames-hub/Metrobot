## Description

This bot is designed to automate and manage a role-based payment system for your Discord server. It allows you to assign different roles to members, and based on their role, they will receive automatic weekly or daily payments. The bot also includes additional features such as item trading, fines, and subscription management, making it a comprehensive solution for role-based economies within a server.

## Features

### Core Features

- **Role-Based Paycheck System**: Users with specific roles (e.g., "Firefighter", "Police") receive automatic payments based on their assigned role. Payments can be configured on a weekly or daily basis.
- **Send/Receive Money**: Users can send and receive money to each other.
- **Money Leaderboard**: Displays the top earners in the server.
- **Job Restrictions**: Option to restrict users from holding multiple jobs at once (configurable by admins).
- **Basic Shop**: A shop system where users can buy items with in-game currency.
- **Item Trading System**: Allows users to trade items between each other.

### Additional Features

- **Subscriptions**: Users can subscribe to recurring payments (e.g., car insurance), which are automatically deducted from their bank accounts each week.
- **Dual Identity Cards**: Each user can have two identity cards (for different countries, e.g., Spain and France).
- **History Access**: Certain roles (e.g., Police) have access to a log that tracks users' illegal activities.
- **Fine System**: Users can be fined for breaking rules or failing to pay debts.
- **Blacklist System**: Temporarily bans users from joining sessions for a specified amount of time.
- **Forced Payments**: Enables certain actions where a user must pay for items (e.g., buying a car from a dealership).
- **Bank Account**: Each user has a bank account to manage their balance and transactions.
- **French Translation**: The bot can be translated into French for French-speaking servers (configurable).
